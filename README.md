To properly run this app, you must have [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) installed for the iOs version, and have [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) installed for the android version.

For emulators, iPhone SE and Nexus 5x with Marshmellow are strongly recommended.

For android emulation for the app to work, you must have the emulator opened already, but for iOs you do not.

```
$ react-native init-android
```

to install the app onto your android emulator.

<br />

For iOs, run

```
$ react-native run-ios --simulator="iPhone SE"
